# STJ4L - Judge Tool for Linux

A tool (in the very early days) for OIers to check the program using test case files. Written in Pascal, runs on Linux. I upload it to GitHub only for memorizing my OI time.

## Background

In the early days (before 2012), we OIers could only use the online judge system (OJ) to check our program or use Cena, which runs only on Windows.

In 2011, I switched to Linux and found it hard to check my program locally, even if I had all the test cases.

## Project Created

Inspired by a classmate, I wrote this tool using Pascal (the language I used during my OI time), which works just like Cena:

- Manage a contest.
- Check all problems / a single problem in a contest.
- Modify a test case file / the program file for a problem.
- It can work on an existing Cena project.

> Fun parts: the project name STJ4L is short for "Skywalker_Z & ToJaRa Judge for Linux", the two nicknames represent me and my classmate.

It helped not only me but my classmates who were using Linux at that time as well.

## Project Deprecated

As time passed, I found a project called "Project Lemon" (its successor [Project LemonLime](https://github.com/Project-LemonLime/Project_LemonLime) is still active now!) which can run on Linux.

It worked like a charm and even had a GUI, meaning I had no reason to maintain STJ4L anymore, so it's deprecated then.
